Todo
====

- revision inventory synthesis, a-la bzr-hg.
- file content data access.
- native cloning - so bzr branch fromgit togit works.
- conversion pulling - so bzr init; bzr pull fromgit works.
- possibly generate a factored out generic 'git' python module if our native
  bindings become big enough.
- TESTS
