Installation
============

Installation of bzr-git requires several things:

1) bzr 0.9 or higher
2) symlink the directory containing __init__.py from bzr-git - i.e. this source
   tree - into either ~/.bazaar/plugins/git, or wherever bzrlib is as
   bzrlib/plugins/git.
3) stgit should be installed, or otherwise make 'stgit' be available to python.
   You can test this via 'python -c "import stgit"'. If that generates any
   error, then stgit is not correctly installed. stgit is used to provide 
   python parsing of the output of git commands.
